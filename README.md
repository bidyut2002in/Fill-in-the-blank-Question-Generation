### Abastract
Knowledge acquisition is the prime objective of a learner from an educational
system and evaluating the learner’s knowledge is the eventual goal of an
examination process. This paper introduces a system which is able to produce
fill‐in‐the‐blank questions to test the knowledge of a learner that he or she has
accumulated after reading a course material. The question generation task is
subdivided into three modules: sentence selection, answer‐key identification,
and question formation along with distractor generation. The sentence is
selected using a coarse‐grain part‐of‐speech tagset. The answer‐key is extracted
by identifying topic‐word in the sentence and question is formed by omitting
this topic‐word from the sentence. This paper also highlights an efficient
corpus‐based distractor generation technique to produce multiple‐choice
fill‐in‐the‐blank test items.
